## üõ†Ô∏è Core Technologies

A quick look at what Starfall offers:

- **Next.js:** A powerful React framework that makes it easy to build SEO-friendly, fast web apps. Enables us to easily do server-side rendering and build static websites.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **Shadcn/UI:** A kit of prebuilt UI components This is perfect for creating visually attractive user interfaces.
- **Aceternity UI:** for other design elements that can make the overall application a little more aesthetically appealing.
- **Neon:** A serverless PostgreSQL database. It‚Äôs easy to manage and scales as your app scales.
- **Drizzle ORM:** An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that simplifies database operations, making it easier to interact with the database.
    - **SQL-like:** Allows you to write queries that feel like plain SQL.
    - **Relational:** Supports traditional relational database features.
- **Clerk:** This handles user authentication. It‚Äôs secure and flexible, managing sign-in, sign-up, and user profiles.
    > We use webhooks to connect Clerk with the database. This way, whenever a user is created, they‚Äôre also added to our backend.
- **TypeScript:** An upgrade to JavaScript that adds static typing. It helps catch errors early and makes your code more predictable.

## üíª **What are the commands that you can use?**

These are the commands that you can use and what they do in brief:

- **`npm run dev`** - Starts the development server, allowing you to work on your project with hot-reloading enabled.
- **`npm run build`** - Compiles the project for production, optimizing it for performance.
- **`npm run start`** - Runs the compiled project in production mode.
- **`npm run lint`** - Checks the code for potential issues and inconsistencies using ESLint.
- **`npm run db:studio`** - Launches Drizzle Studio, a local database browser that allows you to explore and manage your database.
- **`npm run db:push`** - Pushes your schema changes directly to the database, useful for rapid local development and prototyping.
- **`npm run db:generate`** - Generates migrations based on your Drizzle schema, creating migration files that can be applied to your database.
- **`npm run db:migrate`** - Applies the generated migrations to your database, ensuring it matches your schema.

## üë®‚Äçüíª My Journey

I chose this stack because it provides a complete set of tools for modern web development.

Using Next.js and Tailwind CSS makes building fast, responsive apps easy. Neon and Drizzle ORM simplify database management. Clerk handles authentication, which is crucial for secure applications. TypeScript adds extra reliability to the code. 

Throughout this process, I learned how to integrate these tools effectively. It was challenging but rewarding to see everything come together in a single starter kit. I would like to thank DEV and Neon for organising a challenge like this!

## üëå Features

Starfall is packed with features that streamline full-stack web development.

The starter kit includes a complete full-stack to-do-list app with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI, Aceternity UI, Neon, Drizzle ORM, Clerk, and TypeScript.

These tools work together to help you build fast, secure, and scalable applications quickly.

## üí¢ Challenges Faced

One of the biggest challenges I faced was writing the documentation.

It was tough to organize everything clearly, but I made it through. On the flip side, building the "extra" components and the admin page was a lot of fun. The dashboard page was surprisingly quick to put together, taking the least time overall.

## ‚òò Future Plans

The Starfall template is complete on my end.

However, I‚Äôm open to continuing its development if there‚Äôs enough interest from the community.

With more feedback and contributions, I‚Äôd love to see where this project could go.

## ü§ù Community Contribution

I‚Äôm always open to new ideas and feedback from the community.

If you‚Äôd like to contribute to Starfall, feel free to fork the repository, submit pull requests, or open issues.

Your input is valuable, and I‚Äôm excited to see how this project can evolve with community involvement.
